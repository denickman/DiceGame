Flutter & Code Formatting
Dart comes with a code formatter which - for example when using VS Code - will cause your code to be auto-formatted to be more readable.

Since Dart 3.7.0 the code formatter has changed slightly (compared to what you see in the course videos).

→ The code formatter will now remove the final comma and put code onto one line, if it fits the configured line width. This is not a significant change and does NOT affect how the code execute.

Important: You can change this (back to what you see in the videos)!

To do that, edit (if they file already exists) or add a new file analysis_options.yaml in your Flutter project.

On the outermost indentation level, add the following configuration:

# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.
 
# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml
 
formatter: 
  trailing_commas: preserve
 
linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
